# timeextractor
Time Extractor NLP project - locate dates and times in text documents

## Introduction
The project was developed by [Digamma.ai](http://digamma.ai/). The goal of the project is to develop a library to find and extract time/date information from textual documents.

The main goal is to indentify texts fragments that are related to time/date/period (exact date, time of day, day of the week, months, seasons, time intervals, etc.) and make structural forms from them. We tried to detect a variety of textual representations and handle things like recurring times (e.g. "every Wednesday"). 

## Installation

Clone the repository and create `.jar` file, with
```
git clone https://github.com/digamma-ai/timeextractor.git timeextractor
cd timeextractor
maven clean install
```
You will find in `target/` folder a jar named like `timeextractor.jar`.

## Quickstart
Class `DateTimeExtractor` is the main class for using Timeextractor. `DateTimeExtractor` is used by first constructing a `DateTimeExtractor` instance and then invoking `extract()` method on it. `extract()` is convenience method to extract date/time fragments from input text.

| **Method** | **Attributes** | **Description** |
| ----| --------- | ----- |
| `extract()` |`String` text | Extracts date/time fragments with default settings |
| Overloading `extract()` | `String` text, `Settings` settings | Extracts date/time fragments with custom settings |
| `extractFromCsv()` | `String` csvPath, `String` outputPath, `String` separator, `Settings` settings | Extracts date/time fragments from .csv file |
| `extractJson()` |`String` text, `Settings` settings | Extracts date/time fragments and saves output to JSON format |
| `extractFromCsvToJson()`| `String` csvPath, `String` outputPath, `String` separator, `Settings` settings |  Extracts date/time fragments from .csv file to JSON format |

`TemporalExtraction` class representing an element of extracted date/time fragments.  

Here is an example of how `DateTimeExtractor` and `TemporalExtraction` are used:
```
// input string
String inputText = "Reduced entrance fee after 16:30 except for Thursdays. Closed on Mondays.";
        
// extract date/times fragments
TreeSet<TemporalExtraction> result = DateTimeExtractor.extract(inputText);

// print extracted results
for (TemporalExtraction elem : result) {
     System.out.println(elem);
}
```

The output will be:
```
1 after 16:30, [Temporal[type=TIME_INTERVAL, group=TimeGroup, rule=timeIntervalRule, duration=null, durationInterval=null, set=null, startDate=TimeDate [time=Time [hours=16, minutes=30, seconds=0, timezoneOffset=0], date=Date [year=2017, month=10, day=24, dayOfWeek=null, weekOfMonth=null]], endDate=null]], 21, 32

2 Thursdays, [Temporal[type=DATE, group=DateGroup, rule=dayOfWeekRule, duration=null, durationInterval=null, set=null, startDate=TimeDate [time=Time [hours=18, minutes=59, seconds=43, timezoneOffset=0], date=Date [year=2017, month=10, day=24, dayOfWeek=TH, weekOfMonth=null]], endDate=TimeDate [time=Time [hours=18, minutes=59, seconds=43, timezoneOffset=0], date=Date [year=2017, month=10, day=24, dayOfWeek=TH, weekOfMonth=null]]]], 44, 54

3 Mondays, [Temporal[type=DATE, group=DateGroup, rule=dayOfWeekRule, duration=null, durationInterval=null, set=null, startDate=TimeDate [time=Time [hours=18, minutes=59, seconds=43, timezoneOffset=0], date=Date [year=2017, month=10, day=24, dayOfWeek=MO, weekOfMonth=null]], endDate=TimeDate [time=Time [hours=18, minutes=59, seconds=43, timezoneOffset=0], date=Date [year=2017, month=10, day=24, dayOfWeek=MO, weekOfMonth=null]]]], 65, 73
```
## Output Description
The ouptut of the extraction process will be `TreeSet` of `TemporalExtraction` class. This class has next attributes:

| **Attributes** | **Description** |
| ---- | ----- |
| `String` temporalExpression | founded date/time fragment |
| `Temporal` temporal | represents date/time fragment's details |

`Temporal` class attributes:

| **Attributes** | **Description** |
| ---- | ----- |
| `String` type | type of founded date/time fragment (date, time, relative date, etc.)|
| `String` group | used group of rules for extracting current date/time fragment |
| `String` rule | used rule for extracting current date/time fragment |
| `Duration` duration | duration of extracting date/time fragment |
| `DurationInterval` temporal | duration interval of extracting date/time fragment |
| `Set` set | set of frequency, interval and days of repetiotion properties |
| `TimeDate` startDate | info about start date of extracting date/time fragment |
| `TimeDate` endDate | info about end date of extracting date/time fragment |

## Advanced settings
You can modify default extraction settings for some specific scenarios, like:
* find closest day of week according to current date for relative date;
* find closest date according to current date for relative date;
* change found time expression according to specified date and timezone;
* filter extraction rules;
* find only dates that are current date or after current date.

A `Settings` can be applied to specify some additional extraction options, like setting local user date/time, time-zone offset, filtering extraction rules and finding latest dates.

`SettingsBuilder` is used for constructing `Settings` instance when you need to set configuration options other than the default. `SettingsBuilder` is best used by creating it, and then invoking its various configuration methods, and finally calling build.

| **Method** | **Attributes** | **Description** |
| ----| --------- | ----- |
| `addRulesGroup()` |`String` rulesGroup | Adds extraction rules from `rulesGroup` group for extracting date/time fragments |
| `excludeRules()` | `String` ruleToExclude | Excludes extraction rule `ruleToExclude` from extracting rules |
| `addUserDate()` | `String` userDate | Changes found time expression according to specified user date <br> *correct format: "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'"*|
| `addTimeZoneOffset()` | `String` timeZoneOffset | Changes found time expression according to specified user time-zone offset in minutes|
| `includeOnlyLatestDates()` | `boolean` includeOnlyLatest | Finds only dates that are current date or after current date |
| `build()` | | Creates a `Settings` instance based on the current configuration.

The following is an example shows how to use the `SettingsBuilder` to construct a `Settings` instance:
```
Settings settings = new SettingsBuilder()
         .addRulesGroup("DateGroup")
         .excludeRules("holidaysRule")
         .addUserDate("2017-10-23T18:40:40.931Z")
         .addTimeZoneOffset("100")
         .includeOnlyLatestDates(true)
         .build();

```
## Extraction rules
All extraction rules are divided into rules groups.
